The numbering scheme is given as below. This is the method used to show that the rational are countable.


4|7
3|4,8
2|2,5,9
1|1,3,6,10
 |-------------
  1,2,3,4


lets denote the columns by x axis and rows by y axis. 
For the first row y=1, one can see that,
v(x,1)=(x*(x+1)/2,y=1)

To this when x=1, in the y direction we need to add the sequence 1,2,3,.. to get the required numbers.
when x= 2, in the ydirection we need to add the sequence 2,3,4...to get the required numbers.

When y=4, v(1,4) = v(1,1)+ x+(x+1)+(x+2)    3 terms    
                 = v(x,1)+ (y-1)*x+ k*(k+1)/2  where k=y-2
